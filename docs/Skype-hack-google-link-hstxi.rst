Baidu is a Chinese search engine, roughly the Chinese equivalent of Google; the link does not actually take you to a website run by Baidu but. Hi Skype I got report something i think your web site got hack it use real site even use facebook link that what it keep give me google. and if you are still in your Skype Quickly, click Account under the 1st Skype menu or the manage link under your username on your profile and it will.

The desired link redirects the user to a fake page and asks him to enter his password. By entering the password, you have actually provided the password to the hacker, and the hacker will be able to hack the person's Gmail without wanting to perform complex operations, and can access all the information of the victim. Hacking and hacking into a social network account is a case in which hackers attack a Skype social network account and do whatever they want in the form of your username. They can introduce themselves in your place and with the audience. Spam messages include links to sites such as Baidu, LinkedIn and other popular services. If you think your Skype account has been hacked in this way, reset your Microsoft account password. The following steps will also help to secure your account. To make your account extra secure, set up two-step verification on your Microsoft account.
